Take for example some socialized computing services where you contribute resources to participate in a collective service. Socialized services are a class of services based on resource sharing, rather than a specific service in itself."

We however want to take this to the next level with IPFS or a similar distributed file system as a peer-to-peer socialized cloud infrastructure service."

However we would like to go a step further: we are working on a legal framework and protocol to enable offensive capabilities to defend against attackers."

Not only do you tie people and SOHO offices together, but you enable them with common back office and productivity applications they need. Native built in social cloud services and our PaaS layer can be utilized to quickly build this ultimate application on Subutai Social."
