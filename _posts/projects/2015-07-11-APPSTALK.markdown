  long_description: "Think of an Elastic Beanstalk like service that runs on your own Subutai Social environment. AppStalk not only starts, stops, runs, and scales your Java and JEE applications, it goes further by handling the entire DevOps lifecycle from source repository to production cloud environment. AppStalk will support as many application servers as needed to support users of the Subutai Social platform. Presently we are targeting Tomcat, TomEE, and Weblogic Server."
