  long_description: "Communication alone is not enough to really form a capable interactive community. Jarvis collects information as we work at the SSF to help improve the way we teach ourselves, conduct online research, organize and teach back our knowledge to new comers. Jarvis also tracks progress on projects and checks for code quality to enable meritocracy at the SSF."
