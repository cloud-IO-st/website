            At SSF we offer an OS alternative to the crusty excessively process oriented, rules oriented, work
            environments of our boring day jobs. Heck if you can convince your employer to start and host projects here
            then you can be hip even at your day job. Basically we've automated the heck out of everything so computers
            manage the process auto-magically so you don't have to deal with process and managers who just get in the
            way. It's a place to breath and collaborate with like minded, free thinking, and cool developers.

        The mission of the Subutai Social Foundation is to provide a platform with tools and resources promoting
        the
        formation and activities of open communities around projects dealing with P2P Cloud Computing, Big Data,
        Cyber Security, Software Defined Networking and the Internet of Things with a coherent and unified
        approach
        that promotes synergies and integration across all these interrelated and cross reactive domains.

            This is a deep philosophy and one that has been understood for ages in Confucianist Society of which the
            Mongols admired so much it infected their souls. This was also a philosophy of the Mongol General, Subutai,
            who designed his legions to flow like water in combat. Subutai Social holds dear these same concepts and
            applies them to its domains. Most notably by being fluid and migratory in response to the load cloud,
            Subutai Social P2P clouds and their services break out of the bounds of traditional datacenters to assume
            the best shape needed to handle its load. This fluidity is a great power at the heart of the ultimate P2P
            cloud computing platform. By being able to migrate and adapt to the load Subutai Social cloud environments
            formed using hub, trackers enable the service cloud to shape itself in response to the load cloud. Yeah this
            is pretty cool. As we progress with Subutai Social, we explore new ways to share data, to partially
            replicate it where needed across secure WAN overlay environments. This ongoing effort is very interesting
            and several researchers are involved. So my friend, be like water and join our community to experience the
            power of the P2P cloud.
