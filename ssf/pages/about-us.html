            At SSF we offer an OS alternative to the crusty excessively process oriented, rules oriented, work
            environments of our boring day jobs. Heck if you can convince your employer to start and host projects here
            then you can be hip even at your day job. Basically we've automated the heck out of everything so computers
            manage the process auto-magically so you don't have to deal with process and managers who just get in the
            way. It's a place to breath and collaborate with like minded, free thinking, and cool developers.

                The mission of the Subutai Social Foundation is to provide a platform with tools and resources promoting
                the
                formation and activities of open communities around projects dealing with P2P Cloud Computing, Big Data,
                Cyber Security, Software Defined Networking and the Internet of Things with a coherent and unified
                approach
                that promotes synergies and integration across all these interrelated and cross reactive domains.
            <span class="read-more-target">This mission statement is intentionally a single sentence and extremely wide in scope without completely defining the specific ways in which we will achieve this goal. There are techniques and strategies around this that makes this mission statement more tangible once the reader is made aware of them. Let's lightly list some of them arbitrarily:
The flagship project, Subutai Social, enables activities in all these domains as a single unifying (both machine and network) virtualization and orchestration platform in one. Subutai Social orchestrates the secure interaction of networked devices on the LAN and across the WAN resulting in a unique unbounded cloud formation. Small sensor devices, mobile phones, home computers and large enterprise servers can be orchestrated to participate in unbounded cloud environments thanks to software defined networking and peer to peer cloud computing.
Subutai Social ties together the devices that generate data, possibly pre-processing them on board, and ties them together with other devices that contain services for further storing and analyzing the data they produce. Meanwhile the multi-tenant cloud capabilities allow the build out of applications leveraging this information, and the capabilities of these devices.
The Internet of Things is about extracting data from the network with all its devices and their sensors. As part of the same environment, these devices are securely connected to systems that run clustered cloud applications that store and process the information flowing from them: thus they MUST naturally interoperate in common environments orchestrated by a single platform.
Collecting data centrally, and tying together all these devices imposes extremely high security risks making identity management and cyber security a centerpiece of the Subutai Social platform.
So to sum things up, data generating devices need to be tied together to those systems that store and analyze the massive amounts of data they produce. They must be orchestrated to work together in a secure fashion. Although these activities and the fields mentioned in our mission statement are separable, they must be combined and orchestrated properly to achieve our mission. Our vision in this respect is holistic and complete. This holistic view penetrates deep into the development process and back up to end users consuming the information.
For us, the consumption of services and information by end users of such systems begins with collaborative development of both the software and the hardware. Everything is connected so the community of developers producing Subutai Social, from those using it to build environments hosting web scale cloud applications, and those end users using those applications are all part of one glorious organism. The Subutai Social Foundation and its open source collaboration platform fosters the interaction of individuals, corporations, and educational institutions to develop software and hardware for the advancement of these technologies, thereby achieving our mission.  .
All this is way too hard to swallow even by savvy engineer types. We need to appeal to the vernacular of the average man. This above will just not do. A simple image or even a stick figure animation film is needed to explain what we are doing. One idea that occurred to me is to show a bunch of sensor devices and mobile phones and the data they produce. Show how the flow of that information is routed into the big data clusters that also need to be managed. Then show applications are built on top of all this to visualize and see everything.
There will be both an open hardware and an open source software component to the foundation. This is because the solution cannot stop at the software level, again everything is tied together. </span>

            This is a deep philosophy and one that has been understood for ages in Confucianist Society of which the
            Mongols admired so much it infected their souls. This was also a philosophy of the Mongol General, Subutai,
            who designed his legions to flow like water in combat. Subutai Social holds dear these same concepts and
            applies them to its domains. Most notably by being fluid and migratory in response to the load cloud,
            Subutai Social P2P clouds and their services break out of the bounds of traditional datacenters to assume
            the best shape needed to handle its load. This fluidity is a great power at the heart of the ultimate P2P
            cloud computing platform. By being able to migrate and adapt to the load Subutai Social cloud environments
            formed using hub, trackers enable the service cloud to shape itself in response to the load cloud. Yeah this
            is pretty cool. As we progress with Subutai Social, we explore new ways to share data, to partially
            replicate it where needed across secure WAN overlay environments. This ongoing effort is very interesting
            and several researchers are involved. So my friend, be like water and join our community to experience the
            power of the P2P cloud.
