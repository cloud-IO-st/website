        First off we only accept and work with projects that use BSD derived licenses which are compatible with the
        Apache 2 License. There's no games with dual licensing schemes here to run a business. Do that somewhere else
        and we sincerely wish you luck. If you want to commercialize the products here do it somewhere else with your
        own trademarks. But SSF is not a place for marketing gimmicks designed to abuse OS.
      </p><br>

      <p><strong>
        We do not allow projects to dual license or use any viral licenses designed to limit downstream users. Stick
        with the AL 2.0 and you'll be fine.
      </strong>
      </p><br>

      <p>
        With that said you own the copy rights, but SSF owns the marks so you and everyone else can have it free forever
        under these licenses. Commercial companies can come and use the code, or fork it, and re-brand it, but they need
        to use their own marks. The only thing we ask is that commercial versions make mention of SSF product being used
        in their product whatever their product's name is. This is to prevent people from turning SSF into a commercial
        tool. The software here is for anyone. And bravo to you if you do make money from us, then we hope you'll
        contribute back to help support the community that put some coin in your pocket.
      </p><br>

      <p>
        We do tolerate companies that pop up to support SSF Software commercially. They just need to be careful not to
        make it seem as though the SSF mark is theirs. If having your own product at your own company is so important
        just fork the code and re-brand. Otherwise be clear that the SSF product you're selling support for is not your
        company's product. You can however say that y'all created the project at SSF and that your company's engineers
        are developers there. That's totally fine too.
      </p><br>

        To keep the code base clean and free of IP so we can use the AL 2.0 we have to have each contributor at SSF at
        least sign a CLA. Please sign this CLA scan it and attach it to a JIRA or fax it to the number provided on this
        icla.txt document. If you need a CCLA signed please use the following document cla-corporate.txt.
